How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped in finding the code changes done that lead to different behaviour of codes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help in viewing the history of changes made in the code, compare their behaviour and 
    fix problems faster and more efficiently.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros- Commit can be made only at the time of some logical change.
    Cons- Developer may not be able to find the right time to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is because the files may be dependant and needed to be processed together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can be used to get the commit history
    git diff commitId1 commitId2 gives the difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can always come back to the changes in case of any unexpected behaviour.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For version control obviously.
